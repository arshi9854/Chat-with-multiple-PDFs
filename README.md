# Chat with Multiple PDFs

A Streamlit app that allows you to upload multiple PDF documents, process them, and interactively chat with the content using a conversational AI. The app splits PDFs into chunks, creates vector embeddings, and performs retrieval-augmented conversation with the documents.
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and interactively chat with their combined content using a powerful language model. It extracts text from PDFs, splits it into manageable chunks, and creates a semantic vector store for efficient retrieval. Users can ask questions related to their documents and get meaningful answers based on the uploaded content.

The app integrates local LLMs (like Gemma3 or HuggingFace models) for conversational AI and supports memory to maintain chat context. This makes it an excellent tool for exploring large collections of PDFsâ€”perfect for research, study, or knowledge management.
